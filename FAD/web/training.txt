1	"For pedestrians, especially in a foreign city, I do not know the application better. But when you sit behind the wheel - the impression spoils. It is still convenient to find places in it, but do not go to them. Repeatedly the navigator offered me to roll up or turn around so I would be on the roadway of oncoming traffic. Not to mention the fact that the navigator sometimes offers dirt roads instead of normal ones. I spent the whole night at the track this winter."
1	"Disgusting. At first everything was fine, but then - I do not know what it is (the language does not turn to say ""applications"") pereklinilo, but I was offered twice the exact opposite route.

It is filled with a bunch of advertisements for the fake landlord or agent!! �??... For advertising, it may be the main source of income for 591, so it will be designed so that the tet/buyer is not easy to search for a house, because this company does not care about the tets�?? lives, because they want advertising revenue!! So no Will consider the convenience of use and search!! So it is strongly not recommended to use this app to search for a house!!"

0	"All types glitches, clock, aiming cues, stroking cues. Players hacked game. By putting update mode lose. Game allow collect winnings advance. You must wait hour. If choose leave update mode, lose winnings previously game. Even though screen locked. It's lame."
1	"So far great game. I havent swarmed ads, usually every game so. I thoroughly enjoy gameplay, long time fan pool. Great play friends, good time killer!"
1	"The spin modelled correctly. Backspin nothing! And number times I watched balls potted slower balls hit opponent go in. On top white ball rolls way much even low power! On top I pretty sure rules game modelled incorrect, something tk watch for. Other major physics rule based issues actually fun game play."
0	Two screens show match frustrating unnecessary. Especially 5 sec delay right match 'X player wins' well understood coins get transferred.
0	"Called 8 Ball Pool 75% rules makes 8 ball pool absent. For instance make 8 break pull put right back center table, scratch 8 lose game unless made 8 too, make ball break , table still open get choose want , make break follow make another ball still open game sucks dick going try compare 8 Ball Pool since premise game missing completely. 8 Ball Pool built fact make 8-ball break scratch win fun game 8 Ball Pool even allowed name"
0	I keep getting requests gifts even though person say sent never sent all. I know today I got request friend passed away couple months ago. Absolutely disgusting. 1 star
1	"Very good game! I good! I wish aiming graphics longer aiming lines! It would nice tutorials making shots, hit cue, 'English' cue!"

1	Nice game away time. I'm already addict times country Slow Network makes inevitable lose interesting games I'm already advantage. Great Game Fabulous Graphics.
0	"Game bad company tries hardest get hard earned dollars return. Try this, create new account every day 10 days I guarantee every first wheel spin scratcher $250. I 40 times row, results. Crooked *ss company. I feel bad people give company money, mini games obviously rigged. They changed games, still rigged. They rot H***"
1	Why I wait opponent I'm ready shoot???????? Also nothing bunch amateurs slam balls around table get lucky block shot.

It makes game really unenjoyable play cheating a$#holes quit game get away give winnings. I think developer needs crack lousy tallent players. I would keep track report I'D numbers give developers I thought would help. The developers problem taking money care integrity game honest players. Believe better pool game eventually everyone go one, I know I Wii problem keeps up."
0	The game rigged completely. Spin wheel never pays big. The extra guideline removed certain level. Shots defy basic law physics matter here.
1	"A Classic. Cant beat good, quick game 8 ball. Even rookies noobies enjoy, isn't really learning curve. Only downside requires connection play."
1	"I really enjoy playing game, I sometimes feel like I'm addict it. The spin however kinda like prank me, pushes earn coins legitimately. Thanks developers. GREAT GAME INDEED!"
0	When play game n suddenly hv rcv missed call game loss connection.. N kp connecting... That's main problem.. Otherwise game Good.. Thanks.

1	"Great game contains many bugs struck playing suggest many unnecessary displaying middle game ,today I played game even I game declared opponent winner . It eats ram internal memory cache makes smart phone lag."
0	Fun game rigged. I dont mind spending money game constantly losing taking money rigged. I've spent money never received coins etc...on 2 occasions. No refund either.

1	"Sometimes renewal is good, but this case is not, it takes longer before the news is loaded, if it is loaded unberhaubt. It may look flashy, but it does not work. I hope the next update looks better."

Click on menu you can choose from among other simple topics such as ad work, ad car (what?). I did not manage to remove the show from the frontpage. Tip, make sure that users can do it themselves a little, with what others also submit; eg abroad, politics, tech, games & whizkiss if need be nature. Ms respond to what is happening now; theme trump WK. I now have to search for news, find little to come in and I have nothing with show and football, but that is now my obligatory 2 of the 4 option of news theme on the frontpage. If you can handle this and my tip will let it come out more clearly. For now I am moving on to the nos"

1	"This is always a very nice application, but it does not work anymore. You are bombarded with advertising and are constantly reminded that you are not paid, by the presentation of Premium items."
1	"Many items are suddenly premium. I get it on the one hand, but per subscription only 1 person can enjoy the Premium articles, not very smart. The paper newspaper can be read by the whole family, but online it is different"
1	"More and more videos instead of articles. Everything on Premium, I do not ask for. Instead of improvements, only less quality. I'm looking for a better newspaper ... too bad"
1	"Good news until suddenly a virus comes in. Premium. Persistent bypassing does not just go away, bye!"

0	"It is a very bad application. It is difficult to use, it is incomprehensible. I reached Narita airport by using skyliner, but it is not written on the reservation of the first terminal, the second and third terminal or the application. Therefore I did not understand until just before I got off. Moreover, because there is no notation of the north wing and the south wing, I did not understand the platform. If you do not need to use it you want to stop using it. To be honest, the information received by email is enough."

1	"OK, pretty cool. BUT 1 ad, THE SCARIEST AD EVER. It gave NIGHTMARES. DON'T DOWNLOAD IF U DON'T WANNA BE SCARED. And, also, earlier version WAY BETTER This little kids, getting rewards, charging 1.99, JUST 4 A VIP CHARACTER??!?!?!??! NO JUST NO"
0	So fun play top option record screen. So I always usually every single time says can't play video. That totally stupid
1	This actually used good app. Now cannot even guess one. A bot discord works better. I tried twenty different characters... got 3 right. That's 15%. That F- I rate app. And seriously VIP characters stupidest thing I ever heard of. Zero ten again. And creepy anime adds Japanese.
1	"Cool concept. Fun game. When works. Game keeps crashing shows prompt says ""Experienced technical difficulties"". Please fix this. Paid get rid ads I think I already regret it. Description says fixed bug true."

0	This akinator Weird. It stupid opinion. I recommend you. So Retarded.
1	"This best ebook reading app. No ads, Gesture support, TTS, Bookmark. And many more. It may issues, like TTS split text incorrectly ( time, like '12:45 am' splitted '12:' '45 am', decimal number like '12.45 cm' splitted '12.' '45 cm') But overall I'm happy much."
1	"Better, cool reader, moon+reader, kobo. Doesn't contain ads! Extremely configurable, yet easy use. In-text adjustment font size brightness. The complaint is, support google translate, though supports various dictionaries."

But since game's main obstacles rocks jump avoid looking silhouette, gets annoying jump night time. At least give players option turn night time. And tutorial touches bare minimum makes hard advance past earlier runs. It's amusing people highly rate zen mode (because main mode). There point tap quickly longer jump game. Finally, mad deluge ads, run ends suddenly hit ad even ask (I'm fine watching ad I want freebies want chance continue run). I've even hit ads cannot closed never end. How serviceable game?? Also, Paz oaf."

But since game's main obstacles rocks jump avoid looking silhouette, gets annoying jump night time. At least give players option turn night time. And tutorial touches bare minimum makes hard advance past earlier runs. It's amusing people highly rate zen mode (because main mode). There point tap quickly longer jump game. Finally, mad deluge ads, run ends suddenly hit ad even ask (I'm fine watching ad I want freebies want chance continue run). I've even hit ads cannot closed never end. How serviceable game?? Also, Paz oaf."

1	My daughter kids Kindle fire using Amazon Freetime on. Because I returning tablet slow constant freezing I thought would good idea Freetime phone let time time. But nothing like program actual Kindle. It offer videos says I share things purchased Amazon. The actual Freetime Kindle countless kids shows books children 6. Not worth money Android phone/tablet.
1	"It geared towards older children already read. It job lock device, better available task. The content section needs help. As others stated way search specific content, scrolling cover art books & videos. When set youngest setting (3-5 yrs old) book selection includes full juvenile chapter books like Harry Potter -- making setting useless. The video section also includes content age appropriate (3-5 yr old). While analytics offered child's activities great, would useful older children. I see child spent two seconds many books, chapter books, text well beyond abilities age setting selected. I likely keep subscription, access content, I read children. If looking set forget solution younger kids, it."
0	"Used couple times, much 2 yr old. Then automatically charged without warning. Pretty dumb app."

Second, able hit home, button brings recently used things there. Third, crash many things open, I know that's problem could easy fix creating option clear immediately closed. This way 10 background open."
1	"I understand included prime membership, already subscribed. Says $2.99/month free trial. I also see kids shows games; basically setting profile restrict your.child could access use. It's worth $2.99 description misleading."
1	Everything great except get access like fire tablet. This Amazon dicks limiting buy hardware. Well loss lost family subscription.
1	"This really great potential. I like idea able keep kids accessing play store, control content get access via sharing content main tablet interface choosing allow. I like I set age range Amazon content. That said issues: 1. No search feature within books. This ridiculous. Who wants scroll thousands books see book available? Search author, reading level (lexile, f&p, etc.) Would great. 2. I able control content within category. I want able hide content I want available within age range without cutting access content age range. And within controlling content. I love idea timer feature; however, many times I want able self timer I approve homeschooling access apps. Same goes content within categories. 3. Features available kindle available version. Why Audible comes option automatically kindle version freetime, I can't even share version? Like ability choose books kindle account share I able choose audible content I want available kid."

1	Very restrictive locks kids anything fun. Only control freak/helicopter parent.
0	"The content well curated, I give credit due. However, search feed frustratingly slow. So want find specific books, goooood luck scrolling thru dozens hundreds titles MAYBE finding want. Why search feature? Why titles load slowly?"

1	"My car Android Auto, works pretty well phone. I rental car Android Auto worked even better! Update: My car Android Auto, fantastic.

1	"I really enjoy using Android Auto. It's easier faster car's touch screen. I get navigation free via Google Maps music easily accessible. You make calls Google Assistant works okay.

Wish could customize settings. For example spotify buttons gigantic, able make smaller. Also google voice reflect google voice chosen phone."

I wish I playing music Google play would list every song playlists. What would make something I would regularly would could run completely car's head unit solely Bluetooth, I plugging major hassle I like phone charge already 100% battery"
1	"Very useful, practical safe nearly everything... However, using Google Assistant somewhat specific commands gets rather tricky. Spotify songs artwork may register (in-car) screen display. Also, Google Assistant always default app-launching commands directly Google's services. Messaging music services Samsung native recognized Google work hands-free cases. Nevertheless, makes overall intuitive interaction safe drive much like Apple CarPlay."

1	"No complaints, using AA music player. I select albums AA voice control works pretty well, EXCEPT even though I album tracks ordered actual track order recorded, AA refuses play correct order! Tracks 'randomised' regardless settings music player incredibly irritating. If I choose listen album, I expect listen recorded, I listening original CD. Can please correct this!"
1	"When works right amazing I love wireless auto. However I need reboot phone every drive I want work properly next drive. I frequently need reboot least long drive well waze stop updating. If I reboot getting car, frequently remains partially open ending drive unclearable ""looking Android Auto wireless"" notification go away til force close even better aforementioned reboot. Head unit Kenwood DNX995s. Edit: RE: Dev response - I've already done that, along numerous people, nobody Google acknowledged thread."
1	"I Android auto Volkswagen Audi. It provides better navigation experience applications built vehicles. I've used locally long cross-country drives.

1	"I love Android auto, navigating using Google maps always overrides ""avoid toll roads"" setting. Every day I tell avoid toll roads. It play like audible podcasts, sometimes drop inexplicably. And times I'll say ""send whatsapp message so-and-so"" says ""I know help yet"" ... times perform request problem. I've also interpret clear ""yes"" ""no"" - frustrating!"
1	"Love ease app, using new Chrysler I voice command without using buttons. Only problem I Pandora always opened took radio even though feature shut off, finally deleted Pandora together."
1	"I think great car vehicles Andriod Auto compatible. It also great popular like Pandora, Audible on. The thing, I get safety lack abiblity read text lack option immediately make phone calls private...sorry I can't see handset feature car, phone."
1	"This good ease driving. It help keep distracted functions harder get to. Listening music podcasts, showing directions, making phone calls main functions. The issue comes setting auto start feature connect blue tooth. Sometimes I want delay start I get driving, pops right connects. Overall good."

1	I'm conflicted. While I enjoy the game so far, with the variety of pokemon and buddy system, I absolutely do not like the battle system right now. I can understand working. on lag issues but what about that 1k difference between the leagues. Well it's a lot more than one would think. Unless you get real lucky and grind every day you aren't going to get the that next bracket easily and it puts you in there after so many plays. I have a lot more to day but I've hit the cap.
