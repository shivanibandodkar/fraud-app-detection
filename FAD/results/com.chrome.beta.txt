pos	Everyone can visit WEB: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS and FASTER. I love everything you guys did with Chrome Beta that Chrome doesn't have yet... The new search bar in the tabs screen The simple games that come and go The layout of the tabs The ability to preview an image Can't remember all now... But it's truly great Little to no crashes or bugs at all
neg	I have two accounts on my Google phone. It is allowing one on Chrome. Get ahold of me please. My account I've had for several years and I listed all of my accounts on Chrome, this beta has changed my email addresses, it has changed my name on both of my accounts, and it does not list me properly. I have spoken to Google one and they also agree. And being this is a beta, I was given an insight scoop to deal with this with the BBB if Google can't help me
pos	Fast browsing
pos	great

pos	Finally ran its course. I had to uninstall this today after using it for years. It decided to quit displaying pics and links on my website. I thought it was something on my blog I had done, but then came to find out it only happened in chrome beta. Installed Firefox and it worked fine, then tried it in Chrome and everything was fine. But not Chrome Beta. So I guess it is time to say goodbye and wait for the new features once they are all debugged.
pos	Best performance
neg	Ahh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't hate this app
pos	This is a lot better than eating pizza or going fishing

pos	Feed no longer let's you hold to open to new tab. Love opening a bunch up then taking my time to go through and read them. Too many steps now. New tab system is VERY clunky and awkward to navigate. Doesn't focus on current tab when going to tab view and have to scroll to find it. Also, very often tab thumbnails don't load. Again can't find some tabs I've opened.
neg	Critical
neg	After the last update it's exactly the same as basic Chrome and I hate it.
neg	Hey Google! Can you stop changing things don't need to be changed? Pushing tab and menu functions to the top corner rather then the option to have these functions on the bottom bar is stupid. Perhaps team Google has heard that modern phones are big and tall? Think about the user rather than your rediculous devotions to your design one size fits all.
pos	Really good
pos	Nice apk

pos	Good's Apps
neg	Visuals are ok. Videos are alright. Takes time to load but it's good. But you might want to do something about the 'top sites' sections. The app logos were blurry and they appeared too squeezed

pos	Good,but not great!
neg	Settings do not display - just a white info box appears with just the Lite mode symbol. Likewise, long-pressing a LinkedIn produces a white info box with a G symbol. Tried force stopping the app to no avail. I appreciate that this is a Beta app, but consistent, random issues make it difficult to continue use.
pos	Love it
neg	I ilke the design of Google Chrom, not beta
pos	I'm just starting Google Beta. So far it seems smooth and easy. I'll update my review as I go along.
neg	I Haven't reviewed Chrome since 2016. And Chrome was getting better but now again sucks in the worst way. . It sucks do to how SLOOOOOW that Chrome has become in last several updates. It's had a SEVERE "LAGGING ISSUE." I am not the only person that's NOTICED this Problem Either. PLEASE FIX THIS APP TO WORK "CORRECTLY" GOOGLE. 😡 😡 😡... 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻
