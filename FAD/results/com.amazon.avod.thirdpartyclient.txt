neg	Not able to sign in/out of app securely! Videos with mini series (seasonal episodes) issues with play backs, skips ahead of where you left off!
neg	This app watching more movie
pos	Good
neg	Always have to restart app if I accidentally minimize it because it doesn't rediscover either Wi-Fi or data. Search engine still clunky but definitely improved in the last 6 months.
pos	Best applicant right

neg	Bad
pos	Good
pos	They tell 30 days free trail but nothing üôÑüôÑ
pos	Everything is very good.... but One problem is that South's film does not have Hindi audio. So please make it available in Hindi also...
neg	Any series will start from beginning if I hit play from main page. It should automatically start from where I left
pos	Content in limited and not all movies or tv series are available like on Netflix but overall affordable and a good app.
neg	30 days free trial par bhi credit card no.mang rahe ho taki baad me paise cut kar sako
pos	Excellent range of very good movies and T.V. shows.
pos	User friendly... Really enjoy it..
pos	Good
pos	Wow excellent
pos	Searching option needs to be more precise and please add more options in filter
pos	Nice app...

neg	Why movies dont get download.
neg	Bad
pos	Include old movies ttoo
pos	Nothing new to say about, it's SIMPLY AMAZON! Its best asset is the originals, awesome...... But, there should be a review platform for the originals of Amazon's own.
pos	Good
pos	Not great filtering for Prime members
neg	Useless. Will not allow me to sign in at all
pos	Great
pos	Love the freedom of having it wherever I go.
pos	Wastage of time as no good series available as compared to Netflix .
pos	ni ceeeee app
pos	It's a cheap and best app for the web series unlike Netflix which is very costly to subscribe. It's my favorite app " The Amazon Prime Vedio"
neg	1080p Hd quality are not support on mobile phone.
neg	If serching for any movie or other but it showing every time another results This is soo irritating every user
pos	I hate that app Because your contribution is still zero against corona in india You're earning from India but you you don't care about india
pos	Amazing
pos	Good to watch in application üëç, but search results are not so good. Even after downloading a movie to watch, I am getting some unknown error. Rest all fine.

pos	Good
neg	Worst app i ever seen this app many issues and many problems in login in this app
neg	Sign up avatala
pos	Good quality of pictures at a reasonable cost
pos	Compared to other streaming services this is honestly a pretty bad streaming platform. The app drains battery significantly faster than apps of a similar nature, the interface has some lag and unresponsiveness issues, I can't watch anything while my VPN is active which leaves my phone vulnerable, and a bunch of other issues (though mostly minor in comparison to these).
pos	Great app
pos	Awesome...
neg	Some movies are missing not available
