 0.3		1	Huge edit to my review. You guys just removed the live stream feature??
 0.0		1	Find other apps badoo it's about making money the so called free user has little to do in this app very limited close to none you need to pay for messaging others.Jaumo app it's killing badoo already you can text free there if I could give badoo less then 1 I will do it again as year after year is more distinguished and alighted with love to money. Avoid At all Cost you want get anywhere. Stop with this automatic responds pathetic same as your service!!
 0.5		1	Many time free Credit Freezeüò•
-0.1		0	Why are the chats limited? üôÅ
-0.1		0	Even if you set all your settings in this app to never send you a single notification it will still send you several everyday single day just to literally beg you to use the app again.
 0.2		1	To many computers texting back

 0.0		0	Don't download
 0.5		1	Ok
 0.7		1	Nobody talks. Everyone around. E seems stuck up their own arse. You can't do anything these days if you want to remain a free user. Used to be the best app for meeting people like me. Shame

 0.5		1	Interesting
 0.7		1	Good

 0.6		1	Nice
 0.5		1	Not bad.. Its good
-0.2		0	They get your money and then block you without any recourse. Needless to say your money is never given back. I suggest that you stay away from fraudulent services like badoo that pass themselves off as ligit social networks. Consider yourself warned.
 0.2		1	It's a good app. But I'm just confused. Did they remove the live stream feature? Because I don't see it anymore. Thanks
 0.2		1	You have a choice. Pay to talk to the gorgeous girls or get the ugly ones for free! Go to plenty of fish. You can talk to anyone u like. FOR FREE!
-0.5		0	Yesterday take my money without my consent and today also you take my money again what the hell very bad apps and cheated return my money back
 0.6		1	So amazing
 0.1		1	Why i not get live video
-0.2		0	Awful waste of time. Used to be far better than this. Now messaging anyone is near impossible
 0.2		1	You robbed me, paid money for my subscription and never got it I was talking to a good few people on it the you change my hole profile now I can't see no message
-0.7		0	Bad app
 0.3		1	All in all this a great app, where the highlight was live streaming. Now that you have removed the live streaming many people will leave your app and go to others. I cannot understand why would you do such a thing!!! Ideally this should be a huge source of income for you especially now during these situations where everyone is bored at home. I urge you to reconsider your decision and return the live streaming option, because if you don't you will lose the majority of your subscribers.
 0.2		1	Is legit and easy to get what u want in a relationship.the only problem is buying coins.it should b made flexible i.e usage of airtime should b consider in buying coins.

 0.9		1	Very good
 0.0		0	I like the app
-0.3		0	Giving this one star because of the recent inclusion of ads, even if you don't swipe. Disgusting business practice. Proof that the creators only care about your money. Try elsewhere.
 0.8		1	Very nice
 0.2		1	For myself I'm a very respectful person as well as I like to be respected by others. I would highly recommend this as a 5 star but the only issue they have is they tend to block you for no reason. I feel there at discretion to see your conversations but they determined to say that you Have done something inappropriate like has happened to myself. I'm sure many women on here get all the pictures sexual and I find that highly inappropriate. I report it and I get blocked??? I find it out wrong!
 0.5		1	It's ok

 0.3		1	I loved this app I found my now wife to be on here. After quite a few unseccessful attempts on other places. Premium is well worth it. Can't thank the developer's enough. We're in a happy and healthy relationship. Soon getting married.
 0.0		1	Would be a zero if the option was there. They take a full months payment for Badoo premium, then stop the live streaming when you have alot of cashable credits. Then proceed to try and block your account with the excuse someone has complained with no evidence at all. This app is an absolute sham with financial fraud. I for one will take the to court for an entire refund under the consumer credit act and breach of Terms and conditions DO NOT USE THIS APP
 0.0		0	Can you recommend something for me?
 0.4		1	Good app but my live stream gone so what's the point of Being on the app live kept me safe from the catfish

 0.3		1	I think I just met the love of my life on here. I literally had this app for less than two hours and I already met the man of my dreams. we're already in love :) I never thought I'd find the one for me on some dating app
 0.1		1	Suddenly the badoo live icon disappeared why ?
 0.7		1	Very interesting and matured
-0.1		0	After problem with Coronavirus, Badoo began to limit the functions. Actually, you must pay for almost everything, a big opportunism, since they understood that people are bored stuck inside home, the fact is, save your money, because nobody is going to meet you while almost all countries are in quarentine. You will pay for virtual communication, funny.
 0.2		1	My phone number was blocked without reason. They removed the Live Streaming which was an amazing way to get to know people around the world since my area was pretty dull. Only good thing is they finally got rid of catfish..that's it.

 0.5		1	Ok
 0.1		1	I would rate the app, and do agree with some of the users on here that all and all its not a bad app, indeed I find it quite good. However, I'm extremely disappointed to hear that Badoo is getting rid of the live streams, as I actually think this is a big draw to the app for most users, myself included. It seems the live streams have already disappeared on my account even though I updated my account a few minutes before this review to see if the fault was on my end (perhaps nit being updated).
-0.0		0	This app is terrible! Just as many scam and fake profiles as the free as free sites. They used to have great security on uploading photos but now half of the photos have emails and phone numbers written in the profile pictures wanting you to text and email them so they can steal your personal information. They also bother you with fake notifications

 0.7		1	Good
 0.7		1	Great app... Nice working features.
 0.3		1	I'm giving this app one star because the developers considered money the most, if someone likes u, u can't view him or her before paying. It's like doubles taxes. Change that feature, I will love it later.

 0.2		1	Badoo is a good site to meet people, and the people in Badoo are real not fraudulent ones. Although you will still send request and message to some people without them replying you, which is normal when dealing with human because not everyone will like to talk with especially some immature one that causes nuisance. All the same I will encourage anyone looking for partners to try Badoo.

-0.1		0	Dear Badoo, do you block just people because somebody reported him/her? How about you listen to the other side of the story I'm trying to get my account back but I keep getting bounced because somebody allegedly reported that I'm abusing him And I know deep in my heart Ive not done anything like that I need answers please

Maybe I'll try again later.

 0.5		1	I just love this app
-0.1		0	Horrible, over 100 likes you can not see without a subscription this use to be free. Lots of dead accounts. Not paying for it and will be looking for something else. You should ve ashamed to change it to charge a fee when so many are not working due to COVID19
 0.6		1	Nice app buh you will pay before you will chat the ladies
 0.3		1	Most women on here apparently think what they have between their legs is worth 14K. Most dating apps are trash this one this one as well. Way to many women with the mind site of a high school girls, just because u have kid doesn't make you a parent or adult that's a responsibility anyone can take on the responsibility of yourself and that child just cuz you plop one out doesn't make you a parent.
-0.1		0	Took away the livestreams when people cant go outside due to COVID-19. Not a smart move.
 0.8		1	I am a beautiful person
