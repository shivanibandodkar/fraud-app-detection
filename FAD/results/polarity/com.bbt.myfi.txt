 0.3		1	Update. Previous issues have been corrected and the app has been very stable now. I use it all the time without any problems. Would highly recommend it. This used to be a very good app. Made banking so easy. Now it craahes whenever I try to make a deposit. I would have rated it a 5 stars, fix the crashing issue.

 0.2		1	When it works it's ok.. But as of now constant crashing. Unusable as is now. Truist screen too? Ever since that showed up the app has been crashing. Update. Doesnt work correctly with ad blocking/vpn apps. That's the problem. As of now it's back to normal

 0.2		1	I'm back to using my laptop for online banking after using this app almost exclusively for over a year now. Ever since a Truist splash screen is presented the app will not load. It opens with a blank screen then closes. Ocassionally I'm able to send crash data to Google but it's rare. I'm really hoping a fix is coming soon.

Everything was submitted correctly; but kept saying "amount submitted does not match amount on check". Next thing I know, I have to buy a new phone before the app would be compatible. Ugh! More frustrating than it was worth!

 0.4		1	Love the app & user friendly
 0.2		1	I am using 6 Bank Apps for convenience and speed and this one was the best implementation by miles. Bar none. Now, since we received the TRUIST notification, the ability to see the actual check (front and back) that went through has been removed. U only see check# and amount. WHY? How does that improve the app. We have to login to the browser site to print a check that is in dispute, for instance. UPDATE 03/31: App functions are back to normal.
