-0.2		0	When clicking to rate the game , the game asks if its positive or negative.... When chosing the negative option it brings up a in game feedback report log you can fill out that NOBODY ELSE SEES. When clicking the positive option on the other hand the game directs you to the play store review ( brings you here ) SHADY TACTICS. also came back after 500+ days and cant find a sinlgle player to transfer money after playing for hours scanning, cracking , and coming up empty. Booooo! Broken in 2020

-0.0		0	What a joke. "Completing" stage lasts anywhere between 7 and 15 mins. Over clocks don't even register when clicked. Great concept and idea and I once gave 5 stars but seriously got worse. I even wasted £40 on over clocks and as I said they don't even work. What a joke.

 0.7		1	This app is a good news

 0.0		1	At the start it seems like a good game but in a day or two you will max out your phone and then you find out the game is a joke made by an even bigger joke! 22390 days to bypass a firewall that's below my cracker tf? I am a lot higher then anyone else and the scan only finds 4 people over and over again then, i have to wait 22 thousand real days to crack a firewall below my cracker level... In 22 thousand days witch is '61 real years' i won't have this phone let alone this game!
 0.3		1	Lots of fun
-0.9		0	very very very bad
 0.0		0	I am giving it 4⭐ because there is a fault in this game.When i open PNT account and login in the bottom there is something like a line but it is not line.I think it is something written which is faulted
 0.4		1	This is very useful app
-0.1		0	Pointless. Most maxed players are maxed due to glitch/hack. The game is overrun with bots. The game is dead, the developer is only milking $$$ from ad revenue.

-0.2		0	Horrible game overall. It takes days to even have progress, you can't get overclocks without leveling up and doing that let alone is hard. Getting money and keeping it is hard too because you can't have as much as you'd like secure in your bank account. If I could rate this below 1, I would.
 0.0		0	I can't get money
 0.2		1	You just can't put it down. They could tweak some things a bit, but otherwise, it's epic. 2019 Update: Using OC to skip takes more OC than it should, and doesn't always automatically complete the process. The game is still awesome, but you have to have patience with the bugs...

-0.2		0	This app is dead. Removed the ability to halve up/download times by removing another. Now, everything takes 1000+ days. No good updates. Your game is dead. Most useless game on market now. So much potential wasted. Not to mention app makers only allow for pisitive reviews from inside app.
-0.0		0	Completing... takes..... forever sometimes, other than that issue I enjoy it. Could even be a 5 star rating if it weren't for this one inconvenience. For me at least.

 0.8		1	Great
 0.2		1	Great game. But just tried to spend irl money on it. It took my money but didnt give me what I purchased, 3 times in a row. 20$ wasted on the app. EDIT: found the contact email, asked them for some help to resolve, gave them my order number and they had responded very fast, proficiently and politely. Highly satisfied with their customer support!
