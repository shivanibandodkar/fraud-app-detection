 0.5		1	Just amazing So fun Download now
 0.2		1	OMG!! Frustrating as he - -. I LOVE IT!!
 0.1		1	It's pretty fun, but the velocity should be time based. My phone's display is 120Hz and because of that, the game is 2x faster.
-0.2		0	I used to absolutley love this game. I recently got a new phone and installed it, the updated version is the worst. It literally ruins the entire game. I refuse to even atempt to play because of the time lag bt the release of the pin to when it actually hits the ball. Also the vibration is just annoying. So sad that you guys have trashed a perfectly good game. One of my absolute favorites at that! I will be uninstalling after this review, sadly.
 0.8		1	I've already done the 69 level :^)
 0.0		1	Love this game
 0.6		1	well its nice but its lags until lvl 30
 0.0		0	It's trash
-0.2		0	Level 63 keeps cutting off when you reach #7 , no way to finish level😥 Hope you can fix love the game!!
-0.2		0	Before update all was ok. Now, the vibration is annoying and I'm stuck on Level 128 and have been for 5mths. When I tap to release the ball it will buzz and turn Red in a completely different part of the game!! Then FAIL flashes up.....it really was a fun game before the update. Please rectify this problem or I will have to uninstall it!!

-0.1		0	After a couple.of levels it gliches out and makes you start over I redownloaded it on many devices and the game did the same thing ever time. After like level 13 it gliches then makes you start from level 1 again. DO NOT DOWMLOAD IT WILL JUST WASTE YOUR TIME!!
